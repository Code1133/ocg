# Limitations

While the One-Click Level Generator aims for easy and fast level creation, it has some limitations.

- **Terrain Generation**: OCG's terrain generation relies on basic **randomness**. Complex terrain shaping or detailed adjustments must be done manually.
- **River Generation**: River generation only supports basic flow and shape. Complex water networks or detailed adjustments must be done manually.
- **Biome Generation**: Biome generation only supports basic vegetation and environmental settings. It does not support complex ecosystems or detailed adjustments.
- **PCG Content**: Currently, PCG content generation is limited and only supports Static Mesh Spawning. For example, it does not support Actor placement or the placement of complex structures and detailed objects.
- **Performance**: Performance degradation may occur when generating large-scale levels. This is particularly noticeable in levels with complex terrain or many objects.
- **Experimental Features**: Some dependent plugins (like the Water Plugin) include experimental features, which can affect stability. These plugins may change in future updates.
