# Ocean Settings
This section covers the *Ocean Settings* for levels generated by a `MapPreset` asset.

## How a `MapPreset` Asset Creates an Ocean

1.  The terrain is generated based on the **World Settings**, which determines the sea level.
2.  A `WaterBodyOcean` is created at the determined sea level, submerging all terrain below that height.

| Contain Water                    | Determines whether the level generated by this `MapPreset` asset will include an ocean.                                                                                                |
| Ocean Water Material             | The material used to render the ocean. This is applied to the `WaterBodyOcean`.                                                                                                        |
| Ocean Water Static Mesh Material | The material applied to the static mesh used for rendering the ocean. This is applied to the `WaterBodyOcean`.                                                                         |
| Water HLODMaterial               | The material used for the HLOD representation of water. This is also applied to rivers generated by the *River Settings*. It affects both `WaterBodyOcean` and `WaterBodyRiver`.       |
| Underwater Post Process Material | The material used for the underwater post-processing effects. This is also applied to rivers generated by the *River Settings*. It affects both `WaterBodyOcean` and `WaterBodyRiver`. |
